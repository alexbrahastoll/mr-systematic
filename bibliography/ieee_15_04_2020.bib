abstract={The highly heterogeneous environment of IoT (Internet of Things) and Smart cities guarantees that every stakeholder's requirements can be achieved and implemented. However deciding which is the most appropriate sensor to adopt among various similar ones and, even most important, how to use it is not an easy task; a task that, as of today, cannot be done without access to source code or documentation. Moreover heterogeneity in descriptions and definitions complicate sensor interfaces comparison and selection, and may create interoperability and portability problems among multiple providers. In this work we aim at providing a Q&A tool that guides the user in the production of a RESTApi sensor's interfaces according to the OpenAPI specification. The automatically produced ad-hoc specification is used as a base for defining sensors' interfaces equivalence and similarity using natural language processing techniques.},

abstract={A cloud often provides a RESTful interface with which to access its services. These are usually specified through an open but informal document in the IT industry. There is no agreed standard for the specification of RESTful web services. In this paper, we propose the application of an algebraic method to the formal specification of such services and report a case study with the GoGrid's RESTful API, an industrial real system that provides Infrastructure-as-a-Service. The case study demonstrates that the algebraic approach can provide formal unambiguous specifications that are easy to read and write. It also demonstrates that formalisation can identify and eliminate ambiguity and inconsistency in informal documents.},

title={RESTler: Stateful REST API Fuzzing},
year={2019},
volume={},

pages={748-758},
abstract={This paper introduces RESTler, the first stateful REST API fuzzer. RESTler analyzes the API specification of a cloud service and generates sequences of requests that automatically test the service through its API. RESTler generates test sequences by (1) inferring producer-consumer dependencies among request types declared in the specification (e.g., inferring that "a request B should be executed after request A" because B takes as an input a resource-id x produced by A) and by (2) analyzing dynamic feedback from responses observed during prior test executions in order to generate new tests (e.g., learning that "a request C after a request sequence A;B is refused by the service" and therefore avoiding this combination in the future). We present experimental results showing that these two techniques are necessary to thoroughly exercise a service under test while pruning the large search space of possible request sequences. We used RESTler to test GitLab, an open-source Git service, as well as several Microsoft Azure and Office365 cloud services. RESTler found 28 bugs in GitLab and several bugs in each of the Azure and Office365 cloud services tested so far. These bugs have been confirmed and fixed by the service owners.},

abstract={Service orientation is one of the most popular paradigms for developing modular distributed software systems. In spite of the substantial research effort dedicated to the development of methods and tools to support SOAP-based service-oriented application development, in practice, RESTful services have surpassed SOAP-based services in popularity and adoption, primarily due to the simplicity of their invocation. However, poor adoption of REST specification standards and lack of systematic development tools have given rise to many, more or less compliant, variants of the Restful style constraints, which undermine the evolvability and interoperability of these systems. In this paper, we describe a tool that supports the systematization of RESTful application development, through the use of semi-automatically constructed WADL interface specifications, without compromising the ease of the overall practice. We illustrate the use and advantages of our tool on real-world REST APIs. Additionally, we comment on how REST APIs are documented, especially in comparison to the auto-generated WADLs.},

pages={181-190},
abstract={The REpresentation State Transfer (REST) has gained momentum as the preferred technique to design Web APIs. REST allows building loosely coupled systems by relying on HTTP and the Web-friendly format JSON. However, REST is not backed by any standard or specification to describe how to create/consume REST APIs, thus creating new challenges for their integration, testing and verification. To face this situation, several specification formats have been proposed (e.g., OpenAPI, RAML, and API Blueprint), which can help automate tasks in REST API development (e.g., testing) and consumption (e.g., SDKs generation). In this paper we focus on automated REST API testing relying on API specifications, and particularly the OpenAPI one. We propose an approach to generate specification-based test cases for REST APIs to make sure that such APIs meet the requirements defined in their specifications. We provide a proof-of-concept tool implementing our approach, which we have validated with 91 OpenAPI definitions. Our experiments show that the generated test cases cover on average 76.5% of the elements included in the OpenAPI definitions. Furthermore, our experiments also reveal that 40% of the tested APIs fail.},

volume={45},

pages={1024-1053},
abstract={Service-based Systems (SBSs) are developed on top of diverse Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies or architectural styles. Like any other complex systems, SBSs face both functional and non-functional changes at the design or implementation-level. Such changes may degrade the design quality and quality of service (QoS) of the services in SBSs by introducing poor solutions-service antipatterns. The presence of service antipatterns in SBSs may hinder the future maintenance and evolution of SBSs. Assessing the quality of design and QoS of SBSs through the detection of service antipatterns may ease their maintenance and evolution. However, the current literature lacks a unified approach for modelling and evaluating the design of SBSs in term of design quality and QoS. To address this lack, this paper presents a meta-model unifying the three main service technologies: REST, SCA, and SOAP. Using the meta-model, it describes a unified approach, UniDoSA (Unified Specification and Detection of Service Antipatterns), supported by a framework, SOFA (Service Oriented Framework for Antipatterns), for modelling and evaluating the design quality and QoS of SBSs. We apply and validate UniDoSA on: (1) 18 RESTful APIs, (2) two SCA systems with more than 150 services, and (3) more than 120 SOAP Web services. With a high precision and recall, the detection results provide evidence of the presence of service antipatterns in SBSs, which calls for future studies of their impact on QoS.},

abstract={RESTful Web APIs have no description files like WSDL in traditional Web service. Although some REST API definition models have been arising recently, there is still lacking in structured description format for existing large mounts of Web APIs. Almost all Web APIs are documented in semi-structured web pages, and these documentation formats are various for different sites. It's hard for machine to read the semantics of Web APIs. In this paper, we have proposed a novel hierarchical recurrent neural network to convert REST API documentation to structured machine-readable description format -- the Swagger REST API specification. The network extracts the Swagger defined attributes of a REST API from HTML web pages without any feature engineering. With the extracted API specifications, we built an API repository to index, search and compose Web APIs. Experiment showed that the hierarchical RNN model performed well even with only a few training samples.},

title={ICON: Inferring Temporal Constraints from Natural Language API Descriptions},

pages={378-388},
abstract={Temporal constraints of an Application Programming Interface (API) are the allowed sequences of method invocations in the API governing the secure and robust operation of client software using the API. These constraints are typically described informally in natural language API documents, and therefore are not amenable to existing constraint-checking tools. Manually identifying and writing formal temporal constraints from API documents can be prohibitively time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, we propose ICON: an approach based on Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for identifying and inferring formal temporal constraints. To evaluate our approach, we use ICON to infer and formalize temporal constraints from the Amazon S3 REST API, the PayPal Payment REST API, and the java.io package in the JDK API. Our results indicate that ICON can effectively identify temporal constraint sentences (from over 4000 human annotated API sentences) with the average 79.0% precision and 60.0% recall. Furthermore, our evaluation demonstrates that ICON achieves an accuracy of 70% in inferring 77 formal temporal constraints from these APIs.},

abstract={The importance of APIs in software development, especially web APIs, has increased Developers read documentation, which is available on the internet, and use the corresponding APIs in their products. However, documentation occasionally contains mistakes. Such mistakes can confuse developers or lead to defects that lower the quality of the product. In this paper, we investigate the reliability of web APIs by extracting and comparing OpenAPI specifications from both the documentations and the results of the API calls. Almost half of the documentations are somehow unreliable. Mismatches between documentation and the response can be categorized into four types: 1) Undocumented Keys, 2) Dynamic Keys, 3) Unreturned Keys, and 4) Type Mismatched. This study will help developers design more reliable products.},

abstract={We demonstrate how two Haskell libraries - Reflex-Dom and Servant - provide a powerful and complete web development framework which uses typechecking to guarantee many security and correctness properties on both the client and the server. With types as our guide, we can ensure that the data passed to our API is of the right shape, that we are forced to sanitize user input (eliminating most of the possibilities for SQL injection or XSS attacks), and that user input errors are guaranteed to be handled. We use Reflex, a Functional Reactive Programming engine, compiled with GHCJS (the Haskell-to-JavaScript transpiler) to lift user input into a safe representation. Types are used to enforce that all required data is requested from a user before the user can proceed to the next action in a workflow. Malformed user input is also cleanly separated at the type level for automatic reporting and recovery. Tutorial exercises will highlight Servant's guarantees that a REST API is fully specified for all possible user inputs and return conditions. Tutorial attendees will gain an appreciation of how much work this up-front specification can save in development time. For example, Servant knows what all of your endpoints are, and serves error pages for everything else. Servant can also safely handle data conversions from the world of untyped Strings into the typesafe world of your API.},

abstract={Mining data from remote repositories, such as GitHub and StackExchange, involves the execution of requests that can easily reach the limitations imposed by the respective APIs to shield their services from overload and abuse. Therefore, data mining clients are left alone to deal with such protective service policies which usually involves an extensive amount of manual implementation effort. In this work we present RestMule, a framework for handling various service policies, such as limited number of requests within a period of time and multi-page responses, by generating resilient clients that are able to handle request rate limits, network failures, response caching, and paging in a graceful and transparent manner. As a result, RestMule clients generated from OpenAPI specifications (i.e. standardized REST API descriptors), are suitable for intensive data-fetching scenarios. We evaluate our framework by reproducing an existing repository mining use case and comparing the results produced by employing a popular hand-written client and a RestMule client.},

abstract={In this paper we address the problem of migrating a legacy Web application to a cloud service. We develop a reusable architectural pattern to do so and validate it with a case study of the Beta release of the IBM Bluemix Workflow Service [1] (herein referred to as the Beta Workflow service). It uses Docker [2] containers and a Cloudant [3] persistence layer to deliver a multi-tenant cloud service by re-using a legacy codebase. We are not aware of any literature that addresses this problem by using containers.The Beta Workflow service provides a scalable, stateful, highly available engine to compose services with REST APIs. The composition is modeled as a graph but authored in a Javascript-based domain specific language that specifies a set of activities and control flow links among these activities. The primitive activities in the language can be used to respond to HTTP REST requests, invoke services with REST APIs, and execute Javascript code to, among other uses, extract and construct the data inputs and outputs to external services, and make calls to these services.Examples of workflows that have been built using the service include distributing surveys and coupons to customers of a retail store [1], the management of sales requests between a salesperson and their regional managers, managing the staged deployment of different versions of an application, and the coordinated transfer of jobs among case workers.},

This paper presents the design of services for the management of cloud-oriented SLAs that hinge on the use of a REST-based API. Such services can be easily integrated into existing cloud applications, platforms and infrastructures, in order to support SLA-based cloud services delivery. After a discussion on the SLA life-cycle, an agreement protocol state diagram is introduced. It takes explicitly into account negotiation, remediation and renegotiation issues, is compliant with all the active standards, and is compatible with the WS-Agreement standard. The requirement analysis and the design of a solution able to support the proposed SLA protocol is presented, introducing the REST API used. This API aims at being the basis for a framework to build SLA-based applications.},

abstract={Web APIs are becoming key assets for any business. Most of these Web APIs are "REST-like", meaning that they adhere partially to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. The OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) was launched with the objective of creating a vendor neutral, portable, and open specification for describing REST APIs. The initiative has succeeded in attracting major companies and the OpenAPI specification has become de facto format for describing REST APIs. However, there is currently a lack of tools to provide modeling facilities for developers who want to manage and visualize their OpenAPI definitions as models and integrate them into model-based processes. In this paper, we propose WAPIml an OpenAPI round-trip tool that leverages model-driven techniques to create, visualize, manage, and generate OpenAPI definitions. WAPIml embeds an OpenAPI metamodel but also an OpenAPI UML profile to enable working with Web APIs in any UML-compatible modeling tool.},

We provide general guidelines on how to design a REST API for a mobile device and a device description for machine-to-machine interactions.

abstract={Internet Service Providers are becoming more involved in the audiovisual content delivery chain. One manifestation of this trend is the emergence of telco CDNs, i.e., content delivery networks operated by telecom service providers. In this work, we make the case for opening the telco CDN infrastructure to content providers by means of network function virtualization (NFV) and cloud technologies. We design and implement a CDN-as-a-Service architecture, where content providers can lease CDN resources on demand at regions where the ISP has presence. Using open northbound RESTful APIs, content providers can express performance requirements and demand specifications, which can be translated to an appropriate service placement on the underlying cloud substrate. To gain insight which can be applied to the design of such service placement mechanisms, we evaluate the capabilities of key enabling virtualization technologies by extensive testbed experiments.},

abstract={There exists, today, a wide consensus that Internet of Things (IoT) is creating a wide range of business opportunities for various industries and sectors like Manufacturing, Healthcare, Public infrastructure management, Telecommunications and many others. On the other hand, the technological evolution of IoT facing serious challenges. The fragmentation in terms of communication protocols and data formats at device level is one of these challenges. Vendor specific application architectures, proprietary communication protocols and lack of IoT standards are some reasons behind the IoT fragmentation. In this paper we propose a software enabled framework to address the fragmentation challenge. The framework is based on flexible communication agents that are deployed on a gateway and can be adapted to various devices communicating different data formats using different communication protocol. The communication agent is automatically generated based on specifications and automatically deployed on the Gateway in order to connect the devices to a central platform where data are consolidated and exposed via REST APIs to third party services. Security and scalability aspects are also addressed in this work.},

abstract={Today, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is one of the leaders among cloud APIs. Although it was established only five years ago, GCP has gained notable expansion due to its suite of public cloud services that it based on a huge, solid infrastructure. GCP allows developers to use these services by accessing GCP RESTful API that is described through HTML pages on its website. However, the documentation of GCP API is written in natural language (English prose) and therefore shows several drawbacks, such as Informal Heterogeneous Documentation, Imprecise Types, Implicit Attribute Metadata, Hidden Links, Redundancy and Lack of Visual Support. To avoid confusion and misunderstandings, the cloud developers obviously need a precise specification of the knowledge and activities in GCP. Therefore, this paper introduces GCP Model, an inferred formal model-driven specification of GCP which describes without ambiguity the resources offered by GCP. GCP Model is conform to the Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) metamodel and is implemented based on the open source model-driven Eclipse-based OCCIware tool chain. Thanks to our GCP Model, we offer corrections to the drawbacks we identified.},

abstract={PerfMon is a prototype implementation of a real-time performance management method for sensor data communication in assisted living applications. It is implemented in accordance with the specification for GATT services in Bluetooth low energy (BLE). PerfMon provides a tool for real-time performance monitoring and control for caregivers and service providers. Test results from monitoring and control of packet loss ratio related to alarm thresholds are presented. PerfMon is adapted to cloud-based web services using RESTful APIs and established object models. Performance management is a necessary component in an overall management system of IoT devices for healthcare and assisted living applications.},
